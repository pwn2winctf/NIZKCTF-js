## Rules:

Let's start with the rules - specifically what you and your team CANNOT do. :)

**1** - It's strictly forbidden to perform any kind of Denial of Service Attack (DoS/DDoS) against the servers or the competition's infrastructure;

**2** - Do NOT try to use Brute Force on the flag submission system because the flags are **not possible** to guess;

**3** - Do NOT try to exchange flags or write-ups during the competition;

**4** - Do NOT share recent discoveries related to challenges publicly on IRC channels, nor in any other way with contestants of other teams;

Ok, and now, for the more informative rules...

**5** - Our official channel is the **#Pwn2Win** on the Freenode (irc.freenode.net), and it's essential that all players stay there during the competition in case there are important announcements.

**6** - The teams may have as many members as they want;

**7** - We will broadcast lots of relevant information through our IRC channel, stay alert! :)

**8** - The flag pattern will be as follows: **CTF-BR{something_here};**

**9** - The competition will last for 48 hours in a row, no breaks;

**10** - Any kind of violation of these rules will mean immediate disqualification of the team;

**11** - Most important rule: Have fun and Learn a lot! :)


## Operation:

Our judges will be the operators in the **#Pwn2Win** channel (Freenode). Any Doubts, talk to them.

Like in the second edition,  we'll do a **Thematic CTF**. Every challenge context will revolve around a fictional story. Also the Jeopardy challenges, inside various categories (including subjects like **Hardware Hacking**). We choose to use a dynamic scoreboard system, where all challenges starts with 500 points, and according to the amount of solves, they decrease the score.


## Winner:

The winner team will be the one to score the largest within the 48 hours. In the case of a tie, the team that got to their score first will be crowned winner.
